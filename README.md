# Project Title: Exploring World Happiness Trends

## Description
This GitHub repository contains a collection of notebooks that analyze global happiness trends using data from the "Is the World Happy" project. The project aims to delve into the factors influencing happiness levels across different regions and over time. By leveraging various datasets and data analysis techniques, the notebooks provide insights into happiness dynamics, key contributors to happiness, and regional disparities.

## Key Features
- Visualization of happiness distribution across regions using interactive world maps.
- Identification of factors with the most significant impact on happiness scores.
- Analysis of correlations between different variables and happiness levels.
- Exploration of temporal trends in happiness dynamics.
- Demonstration of data preprocessing techniques and statistical analysis methods.

## Contents
1. **Barplot.ipynb**: Visualizes happiness distribution across regions and examines changes in mean happiness scores over the years.
2. **Maxcolumn.ipynb**: Identifies key factors influencing happiness scores and visualizes their impact on happiness levels.
3. **World map.ipynb**: Plots interactive world maps showcasing happiness scores and geographical patterns.
4. **Correlation.ipynb**: Explores correlations between different variables and happiness levels over time.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, folium, etc.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/world-happiness-trends.git`
2. Install the required Python libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Explore the notebooks to visualize happiness trends, identify key contributors to happiness, and analyze correlations between variables.
